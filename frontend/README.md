* **Expenses List**: Displays each expense in a list with date of expense being made, expense item name, expense amount and button to delete the expense.

# The Process

I started by rendering a dummy expense list to layout the basic UI of the app. Then I focused on CSS styles to arrange components in the app so that the UI could easily convey the information to the users.

Next, I move my data into a state. So that adding, modifying or deleting the data should update in my UI.

Then, I add the form to take input from the user.

Finally, I add chart UI component  to give another perspective of the expenses data to the user.

Along the way, while building everything, I took notes on what I've learned so I don't miss out on it.This way, I understood what I've built and it made me realize that we fully understand something once we've actually taken a step back, thought about it, and documented what we've done.

# What I Learned

During this project, I've learned core concepts of React.js  and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking.

## `useState` Hook: 

Using the `useState` hook helps updating the UI when we updates the data stored inside it. 

## Event Handling:

I worked with event listener and handlers, which made the app interactive and user-friendly.

## Overall Growth:

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making an app. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.

# How can it be improved?

* Add more themes like dark mode, light mode, and more.
* Add more text options like font size, font color, and more.
* Add little animations on adding, deleting an expense.
* Add `context` to manage prop chains.
* Add `CSS` preprocessors to better managing complex css.
* Can use a better code file structure.
